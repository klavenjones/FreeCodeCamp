                    Dorothy Johnson Vaughan was an African-American mathematics teacher who became one of the leading mathematical engineers in early days of the aerospace industry. After the U.S. defense industry desegregated, Vaughan worked with leading computer operators and engineers, becoming an expert in the FORTRAN programming coding language at NASA. She worked on the SCOUT Launch Vehicle Program that shot satellites into space. Vaughan and other female African-American mathematicians are the subject of a 2016 film <em>Hidden Figures</em>

                        counterparts, Dorothy Johnson Vaughan became the first black supervisor at NACA when she was promoted to 
                        manager of the West Area Computers. This work group was composed entirely of African-American female mathematicians.
                         The title gave her rare visibility and she collaborated with other well-known computer operators on various projects. 
                         She also became a dedicated advocate for female employees who deserved promotions or raises, often supporting white women as well.

                         becoming an expert FORTRAN programmer, and worked on the SCOUT (Solid Controlled Orbital Utility Test) Launch Vehicle Program, 
                         one of the nation's most successful and reliable launch vehicles. This took place after the agency abolished segregation in the workplace
                         and NACA was transitioning into NASA.

                         which brought confidence back to Americaâ€™s space program
